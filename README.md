# Transformer Text Classification

This project implements a Transformer-based model using TensorFlow and Keras for binary text classification. The model uses text vectorization and positional embeddings to process input sequences. The Transformer architecture includes multi-head attention, layer normalization, and feedforward networks, followed by a global average pooling layer for classification. The project provides functions for training the model on labeled data and evaluating its accuracy.

## Features:
- Text vectorization for sequence input.
- Transformer model with multi-head attention and positional embeddings.
- Binary classification output (sigmoid activation).
- Functions for training and evaluating the model on text datasets.

## Requirements:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy

## Usage:
```python
# Example usage:
model, vectorizer = train_transformer(train_inputs, train_labels, val_inputs, val_labels)
accuracy = evaluate_transformer(model, vectorizer, test_inputs, test_labels)
